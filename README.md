# hedge-phrases

This repository contains 2 files:

1. A paper presented at the 2012 American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) Annual Symposium.

2. Slides from the AMIA presentation.

3. A list of **382 hedge phrases/uncertainty expressions** saved as a tab-separated values (TSV) file. Column 1 represents the hedge phrase, and the additional columns represent papers in which that specific hedge phrase was mentioned, in the form of `[last_name year]`.  If no authors were listed then the hedge phrase came from internal discussions but not from a specific paper.  Note that the original paper described 341 hedge phrases but the file in this repository contains additional phrases found after the paper was published, for a total of 382 hedge phrases.
